# Medical Risk Factor

## Description

The Medical Risk Factor project, is an in-depth analysis and machine learning application developed to assess and predict medical risks based on patient data. The project leverages Python and its robust data science libraries to preprocess, analyze, and model health-related data, ultimately aiming to classify patient statuses and identify key health indicators.

## Key Components

### Data Handling and Preprocessing

- **Loading and Exploring Data**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, containing medical information such as treatment duration, type of medicine, patient demographics, and various health metrics.
- **Feature Examination**: Each feature is thoroughly examined with detailed descriptions of medical terms and normal value ranges, sourced from reliable health information websites.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and converting age from days to years for better interpretability.
- **Categorical Conversion**: Blood component values are categorized based on normal ranges, and columns with fewer unique values are converted to categorical data types. Dummy variables are created for categorical features to facilitate model training.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualization of feature correlations to understand relationships between variables.
- **Sorted Correlations**: Detailed sorting of feature correlations to identify the most significant relationships.
- **Feature Importance**: Use of Random Forest to determine the importance of each feature in predicting patient outcomes, visualized through bar plots.

### Machine Learning Models

- **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Model Evaluation**: Each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide detailed insights into model performance.
- **Results Visualization**: Bar plots are used to compare the performance of different models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

### Results

- **Model Performance**: The project provides a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models in predicting patient statuses, showcasing the effectiveness of various algorithms in a medical context.

## Conclusion

The Medical Risk Factor project exemplifies the practical application of data science and machine learning in healthcare. Through meticulous data preprocessing, thorough exploratory analysis, and robust model evaluation, the project aims to deliver valuable insights and predictive capabilities for medical risk assessment. This work underscores the importance of combining domain knowledge with technical expertise to tackle complex health-related challenges.
